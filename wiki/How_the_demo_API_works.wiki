Example on how to use the facebook graph api framework to invoke api.<br>
i used the api to extract music from my favorite music group wall feeds,<br> then i just collected the data i needed exported it to svc file and uploaded to google docs (also pragmatically ) for using the music clips.<br>
basically so the data wont get lost!

The steps :
  * open the file *`MainWindowContainer.cpp`* look for the *TestAPIs* function this is where the api start to invoke 
  * in the same file look for *GetGroupWallFeeds* function,this is where all the feeds from current date back to the first feed in collected.
  * now in the *`FBApi.cpp`* file look at the top for *`GROUP_PING_ID`* variable this is where the group id should be. but your favorite group you wish to extract its data.
