= Introduction =

i wish to separate the GUI stuff from the logic implementation <br>
that means the logic will be in pure c++ not depending on Qt.
for now i dont see any good and easy option other then using Qt webkit implementation. 



= Details =

Future Plan
  * Linux porting.
  * Mac porting. 
  * separation of Logic from GUI (MVC oriented).
  * keep the Qt at the minimum and depending more on portable pure c++. 
  * finding some other solution and replacing the Qt Browser. i need ideas here ....
